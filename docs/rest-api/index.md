# Public Data REST API

::: warning Incomplete
This section of CH Guide is incomplete and requires significant input.
Ideally, every endpoint should have some info here, as well as general information about accessing the API, authentication, response formats, latency etc.
If you are familiar with these topics, please open a pull request to add pages explaining them.

Companies House offers some REST API endpoints to retrieve public data about companies, directors, charges etc.

Link to [Official documentation](https://developer-specs.company-information.service.gov.uk/companies-house-public-data-api/reference).


## Document API
In addition to standard REST endpoints which return JSON data, there is a document API which can be used to retrieve filed documents.
See [document-api/filing](document-api/filing.md) for a guide on how to use it, and the [official reference documentation](https://developer-specs.company-information.service.gov.uk/document-api/reference).
