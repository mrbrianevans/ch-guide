Companies House offers data in various ways which can be used for one-time queries, 
or for maintaining an up-to-date database that stays in sync with Companies House data.

In general, the REST API is good for one-time queries such as "get the registered office address for a specific company" or 
"which companies is this person a director of" etc. 

Whereas the bulk products combined with the Streaming API make it possible to keep a database always up-to-date with the latest data.
For example, you can load the basic company information data set into a database and then listen on the company events stream to update it when a companies details change.
