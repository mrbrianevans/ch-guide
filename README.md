# CH GUIDE

### Companies House API Guide

An unofficial, developer-friendly guide to the Companies House dataset and APIs.

## Contributing content

Articles are stored in the `/pages` directory. The file structure determines the post hierarchy on the site. Articles
are written in Markdown, and then converted to HTML by the website.

To propose an edit to an article, please fork the repository, commit the edit and then open a pull request. This can be
done automatically on GitHub by opening the file you wish to edit and clicking the pencil icon or the `.` key.

The process for submitting a new article is the same, instead you will create a new file ending in `.md`.

## Report an error

If you spot a mistake or error in any of the articles, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.
